  - Some countries don't get ads. A simple VPN/VPS could be used to block ads by proxying the m3u8 without having to proxy all your traffic (just the initial m3u8).

## Proxy issues

Proxy solutions can have downtime and you'll either see ads or error 2000. This isn't Twitch retaliating.

Buffering may occur at higher resolutions. This happens because traffic comes from a Twitch server closest to the initial m3u8 proxy request. The only solution to this is asking the proxy maintainer to add a proxy in a country closer to you. If they wont then you'll need to use a lower resolution, or use a different ad blocking solution. A VPN might also be better solution for you.
